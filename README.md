# How to run it?
First you need to download the UFI itself(for windows - UFIW, for linux - UFIL) [latest available version of UFI](https://github.com/prostoblodi/universal_forge_installer/releases/latest)

After that, just double click on it.

## Running in the console
Instead of double-clicking, you should write to the console:

`cd /ufi/download/directory/`, where /ufi/download/directory is the directory where the downloaded .jar is located

`java -jar UFIW1.2.jar`(for windows)

`java -jar UFIL1.2.jar`(for linux)

# How does it work?
This application gets version information from the [official Minecraft Forge website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/), then downloads it from the [maven repository Forge](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/)
